# New Pokemon Emerald
_New Pokemon Emerald_ is a Quality of life romhack of Pokemon Emerald using [rh-hideout pokemonemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) as its base. The primary goal of this hack is to remove any friction that I don't find enjoyable and add features that align the game with modern game design sensibilities. I plan to this by combining all the wonderful features that the Pokemon decompilation rom hacking community have implemented that I like into one Pokemon Emerald hack and implementing a few ideas of my own.

# Changes
